#violent Tame
    #original: Torpur tame and force feed
    #new Idea: throw Food in non-Attack Range until it follows you
    #at 20% taming its nonViolent and you can feed it same way as nonViolent Tame
    #maybe you have to add an save area with an Taming trap to feed it

    #alternative: Torpur and add an implant to control the tame
#nonViolent Tame
